My entry for the CSESoc Flagship Hackathon 2022

## What is it?

A new method of finding credible news, as well as being able to figure out what kind of fake news is circulating

## What we used

We used tf-idf calculations to filter out unnesessary words before running our data set through a passiveAgressiveClassifer and ran the predictions against a test set. After that an information retrieval system using tf-idf was made to search the data.
